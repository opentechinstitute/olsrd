Package: olsrd
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: olsrd-plugins, olsrd-commotion-plugins
Description: optimized link-state routing daemon (unik-olsrd)
 unik-olsrd is an implementation of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol 
 for Mobile Ad-Hoc networks(MANET). The protocol is described in RFC3626. It 
 is designed to be run as a standalone server process.
 .
 OLSR operates as a table driven, proactive protocol, i.e., it exchanges 
 topology information with other nodes of the network regularly. It is 
 developed to work independently from other protocols. Likewise, OLSR makes no
 assumptions about the underlying link-layer.

Package: olsrd-plugins
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, olsrd (= ${binary:Version})
Description: various plugins to enhance olsrd
 olsrd is an implementation of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol
 for Mobile Ad-Hoc networks(MANET)
 .
 The following plugins are available:
 .
  * httpinfo      - tiny webserver for information purposes 
  * dyn_gw        - dynamically announce uplinks
  * dot_draw      - generates output (over a TCP socket) in the dot format
  * secure        - secure OLSR routing with a shared key
  * nameservice   - announce hostnames and dns servers
  * bmf           - basic multicast forwarding
  * quagga        - import external routes from quagga
  * txtinfo       - display information about the OSLR node
 .
 The following plugins are also included, even though experimental and demo
 plugins:
 .
  * pgraph        - performance graph
  * watchdog      - detection of olsrd freeze
  * tas           - tiny application server
  * mini          - minimal example plugin (demo)
  * dyn_gw_plain  - dyn_gw without ping/libthread
  * arprefresh    - optimize kernel arp cache from olsr UDP sniffing
  * mdnsp         - multicast DNS via OLSR mesh network
  * p2pd          - distribute P2P Discovery messages

Package: olsrd-commotion-plugins
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, olsrd (= ${binary:Version}), libldns1, serval-dna
Description: Commotion plugins to enhance olsrd
 olsrd is an implementation of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol
 for Mobile Ad-Hoc networks(MANET)
 .
 The following plugins are available:
 .
  * dnssd         - DNS Service Discovery (enhanced p2pd)
  * mdp           - Serval MDP Secure
 .

Package: olsrd-gui
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, olsrd (= ${binary:Version})
Description: GTK GUI to control and get info about olsrd
 olsrd-gui is a GTK GUI for controlling and getting information from a running
 olsrd, a daemon for OLSR mesh networking.  It uses IPC to talk to olsrd, so
 /etc/olsrd/olsrd.conf must enable IPC connections for olsrd-gui to work.
 .
 OLSR operates as a table driven, proactive protocol, i.e., it exchanges 
 topology information with other nodes of the network regularly. It is 
 developed to work independently from other protocols. Likewise, OLSR makes no
 assumptions about the underlying link-layer.
